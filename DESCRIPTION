Authors@R: person("Srikanth", "KS", email = "sri.teach@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Sparse Linear Method(SLIM) predicts ratings and top-n
    recommendations suited for sparse implicit positive feedback systems. SLIM
    is decomposed into multiple elasticnet optimization problems which are solved
    in parallel over multiple cores. The package is based on "SLIM: Sparse Linear
    Methods for Top-N Recommender Systems" by Xia Ning and George Karypis <doi:10.1109/ICDM.2011.134>.
